_**Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis**_ <br>
Code: [life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb](https://github.com/natashairaharko/DataProcessingPortfolio/blob/main/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Analysis/life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb)<br>
Description : This is a project included in 'Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist Career Path' in Codecademy. The dataset contains 6 countries and their respective life expectancy and GDP from 2000-2015. Data loading, data preprocessing, and data visualization was done to figure out the correlation of each variable.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
Result: Visualization on which country has the average highest both on GDP and life expectancy, the growth of both indicators, and whether GDP affects life expectancy.

_**Text Message Analysis**_<br>
Code: [Text-Message-Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/natashairaharko/DataPortfolio/blob/main/Text-Message-Analysis/Text-Message-Analysis.ipynb)<br>
Description: This is an end project for the 'Apply Natural Language Processing with Python Skill Path' by Codecademy. The main dataset is a collection of text messages from various countries and years. The secondary dataset is a collection of text messages with spam or ham labels.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, nltk, re, string, sklearn<br>
Result: Dataset analysis visualization, most common n-grams, a spam prediction model using Naive Bayes.
