## Data Analysis
_**Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis**_ <br>
Code: [life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb](https://github.com/natashairaharko/DataProcessingPortfolio/blob/main/Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Analysis/life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb)<br>
Description : This is a project included in Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist career path in Codecademy. The dataset contains 6 countries and their respective life expectancy and GDP from 2000-2015. Data loading, data preprocessing, and data visualization was done to figure out the correlation of each variable.<br>
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
Result: Visualization on which country has the average highest both on GDP and life expectancy, the growth of both indicators, and whether GDP affects life expectancy.
